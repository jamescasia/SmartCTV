# SmartCTV(WIP)

SmartCTV utilizes your old smartphone as a feature-packed CCTV camera system. It has three main features that makes it way superior to standard CCTV cameras. They are:
* Livestream your camera all over the internet through a website 
* Pan left and right to look around 
* Whenever you're not streaming, it auto-detects relevant events that gets caught on camera (right now, when a person is caught) and uploads pictures and footage of that event on the cloud so you don't have to scan through gigabytes of irrelevant video footage
